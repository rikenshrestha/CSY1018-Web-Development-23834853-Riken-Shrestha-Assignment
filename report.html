        <h2>My Experience</h2>
        <p class="hed"> Regarding Web Development:</p>
        <p class="bod">Before joining the Uni, I always wanted to learn more about serveral things which i got to
            know after joining here.
            I always thought web designing is some cool thing to do, <br>also where you can show your creativity as
            much.
            But didn't know how to start or when to start doing it, After weeks in Uni i found web designing as an
            interesting subject to<br> be learned. Since,Web development is an essential part of the internet, getting
            an
            opportunity to study and learn to design websites has been good and intersting till now.<br>It hasn't been
            so
            long and,ofcourse i get in problem sometimes.
            Also there are times you feel like you aren't built for this or when your mind goes totally
            blank(glitched),<br>
            But after finding the error,the relief you get is astonishing.Recently, i got to learn things like Html and
            CSS,and i say anyone can make a good career out of it and by, So <br>till now i think it is a very
            interesting
            also challenging sub i'm getting to learn.

        <p class="hed">Navigation bar:</p>
        <p class="bod">About the Nav bar,i didn't had much knowlege of it but still i was able to make it possible,
            comparing with other features i felt this was the most challenging one.<br> I had much troubles making
            it,had to
            take
            much help from my module instructor Mr.Chirag Thapa, After inspired from him i gave it a shot and was able
            to do so.</p>

        <h2>Home Page</h2>
        <img src="images/home.png" width="150px" alt="homepage">
        <p class="bod"> As we know,Home page is the face of the website,I've tried to make it look good as it
            gets,firstly i made a logo that suits for my website from <a href="https://logo.com/">
                #Here</a><br>(accessed on 1 March 2023) after wards for the background
            i've taken an image colored bluish,cause the home page is all about attraction and trust<br> which is
            indicated by blue just colors,Also it looks a bit friendly background<a

        <p class="hed">Description box:</p>
        <p class="bod">I gave a small box for the description in every page, just for the context with a hover
            transition.To make it
            look a bit attractive.</p>
        <p class="hed">Footers:</p>
        <p class="bod">I have also made it easier for them to be with me or part of me through my social medias.</p>

        <h2>Portfolio Page</h2>
        <img src="images/port.png" width="150px" alt="portfolio page">
        <p class="bod">Same as the home page for the Nav bar execept i chnaged it a bit regarding the colors and
            header,and about the background i changed it so that it looks a bit<br> different from the home page
            itself,for
            this i chose darkish blue cause this page is all about my informations hence, to let all know that it's all
            true and trust worthy.<br>
            I have taken a image from <a href="https://www.telerik.com/fiddler/fiddler-classic">#Here</a> accessed on
            (22

        <p class="hed">Grid:</p>
        <p class="bod">So, in this page we were told to showcase ourselves.Firstly i made a grid of 4 columns and added
            some of my images there just to make sure how i look in real life <br>then added a see more.. option just
            incase
            if
            someone wants to know more about me.Also added a hover transition to look attractive.</p>

        <img src="images/contact.png" width="150px" alt="contact page">
        <p class="bod">About the contact page,i made a card like structure to insert their details there efficienty. In
            thi page i used a white background which represents simplicity and purity,<br>also i think contact page is
            all
            about those things also from the beginning, you can see at every page that i've used white also if not much
            but some sort of portions.<br> In my view white is the most magnificient color to ever exist. </p> i took an
        image from
        <p class="hed">Card:</p>
        <p class="bod">About the card, i made it look a bit colorful so that people don't get bored while giving their
            details.</p>
