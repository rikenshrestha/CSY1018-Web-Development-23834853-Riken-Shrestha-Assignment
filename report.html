        <h2>My Experience</h2>
        <p class="hed"> Regarding Web Development:</p>
        <p class="bod"> Since,Web development is an essential part of the internet, getting
            an
            opportunity to study and learn to design websites has been good and intersting till now.<br>It hasn't been
            so
            long and,ofcourse i get in problem sometimes.
            Also there are times you feel like you aren't built for this or when your mind goes totally
            blank,<br>
            But after finding the error,the relief you get is astonishing.Recently, i got to learn things like Html and
            CSS,and i say anyone can make a good career out of it and by, So <br>till now i think it is a very
            interesting
            also challenging subject i'm getting to learn.

            comparing with other features i felt this was the most challenging one.<br> I had much troubles making
            it,had to
            take
            much help from my module instructor Mr.Chirag Thapa, After inspired from him i gave it a shot and was able
            to do so.</p>

            i chosed a mountainous image from <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/9wg5jCEPBsw">#Here</a> the home page
            is all about attracting viewers<br> which is
            indicated by the beauty of mountains,Also it looks a bit clean background</p>
        <p class="hed">Home Image:</p>
        <p class="hed">Description box:</p>
        <p class="bod">I gave a small box for the description in every page, just for the context with a hover
            transition.To make it
            look a bit attractive.</p>
        <p class="hed">Background Animation:</p>
        <p class="bod">Also for the background i tried to make it look more clean by adding some snowflakes animations
            from <a href="https://www.istockphoto.com/photo/snowflake-icon-gm843268998-142904495?"></a>, about
            animation I have'nt learn much of it,but still tried my best with some helping hands like

            some of the images there just to make it look covered. <br>then added a see more.. option just
            incase
            if
            someone wants to know more.Also added a hover transition to make it look attractive.</p>

            which represents simplicity and purity,<br>also
            you can see at every page that i've used white also if not much
            but some sort of portions.<br> In my view white is the most magnificient color to ever exist.
